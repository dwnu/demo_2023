Demo of my current architecture approach.

## Notes

- Nothing matters if the team is not on the same page. Being open-minded and also sticking to conventions is crucial.

- I'm fan of atomic commits. In this repository you won't find it, unfortunately. 
- The presentation layer is extremely simple. The focus went into other layers. 
- I value unit tests. Integration and widget tests not so much but of course they also have their place in some cases ;) 
- I know bloc, provider, and riverpod and used them commercially but I slightly prefer riverpod over others.
- Strict lint rules are the way to go <3
